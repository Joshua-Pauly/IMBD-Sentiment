# IMDB-Sentiment

In this project I trained three types of RNNs: Vanilla RNN, LSTM, and GRU to predict the sentiment on IMDB reviews. 

The IMDB data set consists of 25000 training sequences and 25000 test sequences with the outcome being binary(positive/negative)

The highest accuracy score was the GRU model with 86.7% accuracy, however this model had the slowest run time.
